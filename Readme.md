# Python Exercises Repo

## Objective

This repo contains learning exercises that I am using to refine my Python knowledge. Initially, the work will be on basic Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. I will later expand this work to include some machine learning work.

## Work

### RegenHousingGraph

I saw an interesting graph on twitter. I captured the code from an image and duplicated the chart. I need to understand how this graph works.

### StandardMatplotLib

This is just a simple Matplotlib chart. Just for practice.

### Tupes2Columns

A twitter person had an interesting data frame with a column of tuples and they needed to take the tuples and break them up into columns.

## Questions

1. What does the process library do?

I may not have recorded the name properly. Check this.

2. Understand what calibration curves are ([link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-evaluate-a-logistic-regression-model#:~:text=A%20logistic%20regression%20model's%20performance%20may%20be%20evaluated%20using%20a,information%20criteria%2C%20and%20sensitivity%20analysis.))

The calibration curve is a graph that depicts the connection between expected and observed probability. The calibration curve may be used to determine if the model is well calibrated, that is, whether the projected probability of the outcomes is near to the real probabilities of the events.

The points on the calibration curve will be near the diagonal line if the projected probabilities are adequately calibrated, showing that the model is accurately forecasting the probabilities. If the points depart from the diagonal line, the model is not properly calibrated, and the projected probabilities may need to be changed.

3. What does Python's record linkage library do?

The Python Record Linkage toolkit is a library to link records in or between data sources. The toolkit provides most of the tools needed for record linkage and deduplication. The package contains indexing methods, functions to compare records and classifiers.
