# Python Exercises Repo

## Objective

This repo contains learning exercises that I am using to refine my Python knowledge. Initially, the work will be on basic Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy. I will later expand this work to include some machine learning work.

## Work

### RegenHousingGraph

I saw an interesting graph on twitter. I captured the code from an image and duplicated the chart. I need to understand how this graph works.

### StandardMatplotLib

This is just a simple Matplotlib chart. Just for practice.

### Tupes2Columns

A twitter person had an interesting data frame with a column of tuples and they needed to take the tuples and break them up into columns.
