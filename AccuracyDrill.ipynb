Upweighting means adding an example weight to the downsampled class equal to the factor by which you downsampled 1.\n",

    "7. Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff in model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a design consideration when training a machine learning model. Certain algorithms inherently have a high bias and low variance and vice-versa. The concept of bias-variance tradeoff is clearly explained in this source so you can make an informed decision when training your ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, bias is the inability of a machine learning model to capture the true relationship between the data variables. It is caused by the erroneous assumptions that are inherent to the learning algorithm. For example, in linear regression, the relationship between the X and the Y variable is assumed to be linear, when in reality the relationship may not be perfectly linear. High bias indicates more assumptions in the learning algorithm about the relationships between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, variance is nothing but the concept of the model overfitting on a particular dataset. If the model learns to fit very closely to the points on a particular dataset, when it used to predict on another dataset it may not predict as accurately as it did in the first. Variance is the difference in the fits between different datasets1"

    "\n",
    "Estimating machine learning model accuracy can be challenging. Here are some possible challenges you may face and their solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Overfitting**: Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too well. The solution is to use regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Underfitting**: Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and does not fit the training data well. The solution is to use a more complex model or add more features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Imbalanced Data**: Imbalanced data occurs when one class has significantly more samples than another class. The solution is to use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score instead of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Leakage**: Data leakage occurs when information from the test set is used to train the model. The solution is to use cross-validation or hold-out validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Missing Data**: Missing data occurs when some data points are missing from the dataset. The solution is to use imputation techniques such as mean imputation or regression imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Non-representative Data**: Non-representative data occurs when the training data does not represent the real-world distribution of data. The solution is to collect more representative data or use transfer learning.\n",
