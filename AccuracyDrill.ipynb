It involves splitting the dataset into k-folds and training the model on k-1 folds while testing it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold being used as the test set once. The results are then averaged to give an estimate of the model's performance.\n",

Downsampling (in this context) means training on a disproportionately low subset of the majority class examples. Upweighting means adding an example weight to the downsampled class equal to the factor by which you downsampled 1.\n",

    "7. Understanding the bias-variance tradeoff in model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a design consideration when training a machine learning model. Certain algorithms inherently have a high bias and low variance and vice-versa. The concept of bias-variance tradeoff is clearly explained in this source so you can make an informed decision when training your ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, bias is the inability of a machine learning model to capture the true relationship between the data variables. It is caused by the erroneous assumptions that are inherent to the learning algorithm. For example, in linear regression, the relationship between the X and the Y variable is assumed to be linear, when in reality the relationship may not be perfectly linear. High bias indicates more assumptions in the learning algorithm about the relationships between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, variance is nothing but the concept of the model overfitting on a particular dataset. If the model learns to fit very closely to the points on a particular dataset, when it used to predict on another dataset it may not predict as accurately as it did in the first. Variance is the difference in the fits between different datasets1"

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently .\n",
