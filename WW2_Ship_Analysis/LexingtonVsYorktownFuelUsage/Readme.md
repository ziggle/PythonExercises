## Fuel Comparison Between Lexington and Yorktown

Mentioned by Sam M.

There were two Lexington's: CV2 and CVX. CV2 is the same class as CV3, the Saratoga. Both are CV3 class. That is the fuel I will use.

Yorktown uses 4179 barrels per day at 28 knots. Lexington at the same speed uses 12324 barrels per day. That is a massive difference.
