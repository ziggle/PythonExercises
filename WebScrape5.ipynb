      "I do not like mosquitoes — who does? To reduce the number of mosquitoes at my Northern Minnesota cabin, I decided to buy a Mosquito Magnet (Figure 1). I bought it last year, and while it ran for a while, it soon gave me an error warning (fast flashing LED) and stopped working. I live in a remote location, and getting things serviced is difficult, so I put it away for when I had time to look at it.\n",
      "Unfortunately, we have quite a mosquito population this year, and my family has demanded that I take active measures to reduce the mosquito population. So I pulled the Mosquito Magnet out of storage and repaired it with the help of a Youtube video (Link).\n",
      "It turns out I had a loose thermistor, and I was able to secure it in place. While repairing it, I also went through the cleaning process (Link).\n",
      "I decided to do a little testing and gather a little data. In this post, I will look at the unit's rate of propane use. I will discuss its effectiveness in capturing mosquitos in a later post.\n",
      "I am working this summer from my cabin's garage. During the day, I walk between the garage and my cabin multiple times. The Mosquito Magnet is along the path between the cabin and the garage, so I stop during my walk and use a fish scale to measure the propane tank weight.\n",
      "I performed the test over four days because I suspected the flow rate would vary by the tank pressure. While I did not measure the tank pressure, I did measure the weight of propane in the tank, which should be related to the pressure.\n",
      "Equation 1 can be used to calculate the weight of propane left in the tank.\n",
      "where\n",
      "My tank weight measurement was subject to some variation because I was holding the propane tank in the air by the scale. Fortunately, I took lots of measurements over time, and the errors should average out.\n",
      "The Mosquito Magnet vendor states that a 20 lb propane tank should last ~3 weeks. We can compute the expected burn rate using Equation 2.\n",
      "where\n",
      "The unit stopped running when the amount of propane in the tank reached ~2 lbs. Figure 2 shows the tank weight versus time on day 2 of the testing. Day 2 began with 7.7 lbs of propane in the tank — a couple of pounds shy of halfway full = 9.5 lbs = (17 lbs+2 lbs)/2. All of my data is in the worksheet attached here. The rate of use did vary by day. The more propane in the tank, the higher the burn rate.\n",
      "Figure 2: Measured Mosquito Magnet Propane Usage.The tank had 7.7 lbs of propane at the start of the test.\n",
      "Figure 3 shows how the propane burn rate varies with the weight of propane in the tank. This figure shows that the propane burn rate reduces as the tank depletes. I would estimate the average burn rate for 9.5 lbs of propane as 0.74 lbs/day = 0.70 lbs/day (7.7 lbs value)+ 0.02 lbs/day/lbs ⋅ 2 lbs. This is pretty close to the vendor's value of 0.81 lbs/day, considering the crudeness of my measurement technique.\n",
      "Figure 3: Variation in Daily Propane Use with Tank Weight.\n",
      "The Mosquito magnet does use ~0.81 lb/day of propane when averaged over a full tank. However, the rate of propane consumption varies with the amount of propane in the tank.\n",

      "I recently watched a series of videos on WW2TV about the escape of 76 prisoners of war from Stalag Luft III in Germany (now Poland) — an event now known as The Great Escape. The story was immortalized in a large-budget Hollywood movie called The Great Escape.\n",
      "While the movie did a good job of describing the construction of the tunnel, much of the rest of the movie was pure fiction. Watching the movie did motivate me as a boy to read the book of the same name by the Australian author Paul Brickhill, a prisoner at the camp who assisted with the escape, but was not one of the escapers.\n",
      "One of the great inaccuracies of the movie was in the role of the American prisoners. While some Americans assisted early on with the tunnel operation, none were at the camp at the time of the escape (link). One of The Great Escape segments on WW2TV mentioned that most of the escapees were not British, which motivated me to look at the nationalities of those who escaped. This was a nice little Excel exercise whose results are presented below. For those who like to follow along, my workbook is here.\n",
      "The prisoners started three tunnels, called Tom, Dick, and Harry, but only Harry was used in the escape (Figure 2). The construction of the tunnels required an impressive level of organization, particularly considering how the camp was built on sand that required shoring to prevent collapse. The plan was to free 200 prisoners, but various difficulties limited the number of escapees to 76. Of these, 50 were executed for escaping. My objective here is to break down the 76 escapees by nationality.\n",

      "I recently noticed that combinedfleet.com has excellent summaries of the WW2 US submarine patrol reports that are very easy to scrape for data. These patrol reports are interesting because they provide accurate data as to the rate of torpedo firings by US submarines and some indications as to the mix of torpedoes being fired. Like all WW2 records, not every patrol recorded the weapons used and it is difficult to know how accurate the hit count is.\n",
      "I will scrape the patrol report pages for 238 submarines and turn the data into graphs and tables that provide insight as to the tempo of US submarine combat in WW2. My workbook is available here for those who like to follow along with the analysis. Note that I used a VBA routine to extract URLs.\n",
      "This post is focused on using WW2 historical data to illustrate how to perform data scraping operations. I should note that the results I obtain here vary slightly from results published in other sources, which I show below. This is a common problem with WW2 sources. Often, the results are different because of OCR errors — to be clear, I do not know the source of the difference here.\n",
      "Definition errors are also an issue – like what constitutes a torpedo (for example, an air-launched homing torpedo deliberately mislabeled as a Mk 21 Mine). Finally, the skippers on some of the patrol reports in some cases simply didn't say what kind of torpedo they launched. They were busy at the time and can be forgiven for simple omissions.\n",
      "The book Ship Killers (Widenberg and Polmar) has two tables that contain similar information. As is typical for WW2 information, the data between the two tables do not agree in terms of weapons used and totals. However, the results are similar to what I obtained by scraping the Combined Fleet website in broad terms.\n",
      "Table 1 shows the number of torpedos fired by type and their hit rates. Note that I generally do not give much credence to hit counts because of the difficulty of confirming the information, while the number of torpedoes fired is fairly easy to tally.\n",

I recently heard a historian (Drach) say that the UK lost 135 major warships in the Mediterranean Theater during WW2. I must admit that I was surprised at the high losses and decided to investigate further. This theater saw numerous major battles (examples like Taranto, Cape Matapan) and some real technology innovations (example in Figure 1).\n",
      "I decided to do a bit of research and see if I could find out more about the 135 warships.

Unfortunately, like all converted WW2 records, there are numerous typographic issues that had to be corrected.\n",
      "I did find that 135 Royal Navy warships were lost during the Battle of the Mediterranean. This was a tough campaign. For comparison, the UK lost 45 submarines in the Med (see Figure 3), which is not much less than the 52 submarines the US lost during the entire Pacific War.\n",

      "When I was studying history in high school and at university, Robert E. Lee was described as a military genius and U.S. Grant was an unremarkable general that only won by butchering his own troops in bloody frontal assaults.  I recently read an article called The Butchers Bill by the Civil War researcher Edward Bonekemper that argues that it was Lee and not Grant that lost the most troops. For each general, Bonkemper presented casualty tables by battle to make his point. Unfortunately, the two tables are behind a paywall. However, you can find a blog post that shows them, along with an important typo correction (magazine reversed column titles).\n",
      "I decided to try to duplicate Bonekemper's tables by doing a bit of web scraping. This post uses a combination of data from a Github repo by Jeffery Arnold that contains a fantastic amount of Civil War battle data that I augmented with some Wikipedia scraping to assign generals to battle. I should note that my casualty results are significantly different than Bonekemper's – I assume because there are large differences between sources of Civil War casualty data.

My results do show that troops under Grant suffered fewer casualties than those under Lee, which agrees with Bonekemper's results. However, my casualty totals for each general in each category (Confederate, Union) are lower. I am sure this is because of different sources being used for casualty totals.\n",

I will then create some tables that look at the casualties by ship type and country of origin.\n",
      "For those who like to follow along, my spreadsheet is here.\n",
      "I am looking at the ships listed in Figure 1. Some ships officially listed as lost at Guadalcanal are not shown in Figure 1. For example, the USS Benham is not shown but was seriously damaged on 15-Nov-1942 and ended up being sunk by Allied gunfire. The USS Jarvis and USS Juneau are also not shown. I do not know why, but their locations may not be known.\n",
      "The video shown in Figure 2 provides a good overview of the Battle of Savo Island, which may be the worst loss in USN history and contributed four wrecks to Ironbottom Sound. The tale of this battle highlights many of the issues that the Allies would need to resolve quickly\n",
      "This battle also shows the importance of leadership. If you want to see an example of how not to lead a naval force, read about Captain Howard Bode.\n",
      "I used the online and free Convertio tool to generate a spreadsheet of all the text in Figure 1. I needed to delete the lightly colored geographic names from the conversion.\n",
      "Once the OCR was cleaned up, I augmented the image data with naval service and ship type information,  and then made pivot tables of the result.\n",
      "Figure 3 shows the number of wrecks by the naval service. Notice how the USN took a real beating.\n",
      "Figure 3: Ironbottom Sound Wrecks By Navy.\n",
      "Figure 4 shows the wrecks by the type of ship. As far as the military ships go, destroyers and cruisers dominate the losses. I should mention the loss of the oiler Kanawha. The oilers were critical to the US Navy maintaining its tempo of operations. The US Navy early in WW2 was seriously short of oilers, particularly fleet oilers capable of Underway Replenishment (UNREP). For example, the loss of the fleet oiler USS Neosho at the Battle of Coral Sea was considered almost as serious as the loss of the carrier USS Lexington.\n",
      "Figure 4: List of Ironbottom Sound Wrecks By Ship Type.\n",
      "Figure 5, shows the US Navy wrecks by type. Of the seven cruisers wrecks at Ironbottom Sound, six are from the US Navy and the seventh is Australian. The US cruisers really took a beating, particularly from torpedoes like the IJN Long Lance.\n",
      "Figure 5: US Navy Wrecks By Type.\n",
      "Figure 6 shows the US Navy cruiser wrecks. One of the wrecks is the bow of the USS Minneapolis, which a Long Lance torpedo hit separated from the rest of the ship. The USS Minneapolis was repaired and served out the rest of the war.\n",
      "Figure 6: US Navy Cruiser Losses.\n",
      "While the Guadalcanal Campaign was a brutal battle, there were some lessons that probably could not be learned any other way than through enemy engagement. Here are some of the key things that the Allies had to learn:\n",
      "I would argue the USN, in particular, did not learn quickly. However, there are people who might disagree (Trent Hone in his excellent book Learning War).\n",
      "Excerpt from Battles That Changed American History: 100 of the Greatest Victories and Defeats by Spence Tucker (link).\n",
      "\n",
      "Quote of the Day\n",
      "The world always seems brighter when you've just made something that wasn't there before.\n",
      "— Neil Gaiman. Yup – this is what I love about engineering. I get to make new things all the time.\n",
      "Figure 1: Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel (LCVP). The most common type of USN vessel during WW2.\n",
      "I have been researching some of the work of Alfred Thayer Mahan, a US Navy officer and strategist, that was an influential voice in the 19th-century military circles. He was a strong advocate for the role of sea power in securing economic opportunity (link). This research has motivated me to determine how US Navy ship numbers have varied with time.\n",
      "Mahan wrote when the US had a very weak navy and advocated for increasing the navy's number of capital ships (link) and foreign bases. Interestingly, Mahan was a rather poor ship captain and was involved in a number of ship collisions (link). I always find it interesting when you find strategists that are not particularly good at low-level functions – yet we usually promote people based on their low-level performance. Similarly, Nimitz was a good strategist but, like Mahan, I would not want him conning my ship (link).\n",
      "My reading and watching lectures on Mahan have motivated me to look at how the US Navy grew and shrank over the years. Fortunately, the Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC) have an excellent page on the size of the US Navy over time. Unfortunately, the data is scattered throughout the page and it must be scrapped so that I can consolidate and graph it. This post is about using Power Query to scrape the data from the page and generate a graph in Excel of the number of active ships in the US Navy over time.\n",
      "For those who like to follow along, my Excel workbook is here.\n",
      "My analysis was motivated by a statement in this Youtube lecture on Mahan where John Kuehn mentioned that the US Navy in the late 1800s has less than 40 ships. I was surprised at that number and I wanted to investigate further.\n",
      "The NHHC website is a bit odd in that it has broken up the US Navy ship number data into multiple tables that contain various numbers of years worth of ship type and number data. I could use R or Python to scrape the page, but I am in a hurry and Power Query grabs web tables very cleanly and quickly. Here is the process:\n",
      "Figure 3 show my plot of the scraped ship number data.\n",
      "Figure 3: US Navy Total Active Ships Versus Time.\n",
      "Here is what the graph tells me:\n",
      "I am going to use this as an exercise for Excel students because I was able to solve a relatively tough problem very quickly (I had data in about 10 minutes). The problem provides students with experience in:\n",
